Content discovery is the process of identifying, finding, and accessing digital content (files, pages, or information) that is not immediately visible or easily accessible. It involves using automated tools, search techniques, or AI-driven recommendations to surface relevant material, whether for user engagement in marketing or to identify hidden,, sensitive data in web security.
