SQL Injection:
SQL Injection is a security vulnerability frequently encountered in web applications. In this attack, a hacker inserts malicious SQL code into the application's input fields (e.g., a login form, a search box) to send unauthorized queries to the database. The goal is to steal or delete data from the database or to gain full access to the system.

NoSQL Injection:
It is often believed that NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) are completely secure because they do not use SQL code. However, this is false. NoSQL databases are also vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks. In these attacks, hackers can bypass filters by using the database's own syntax (for example, JSON operators).
