Cryptography is the science and practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and keys, allowing only authorized parties to read or process it. It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation, essential for protecting digital communications, bank transactions, and passwords.
